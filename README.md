RTW Backend
===========
RTW is an experimental project that solves an age-old problem on wiki's. What happens when an article is edited by 2 or more people at the same time?
RTW stands for Real-Time Wiki, and it provides a Google Docs/Etherpad-like experience when editing articles. It prevents edit conflicts, and makes the wiki more responsive.
This is the frontend.
